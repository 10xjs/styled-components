# Client-side rendering benchmarks

These benchmarks stress-test client-side rendering performance.

## Running

First build the benchmark app:

```sh
yarn run build
```

Then either run the benchmarks headlessly..

```sh
node run-headless.js
```

...or open the benchmark app in your browser to play around with it:

```sh
open dist/index.html
```
