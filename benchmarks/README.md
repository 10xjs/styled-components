# styled-components benchmarks

There are two sets of benchmarks here, one for client-side and one for server-side rendering performance. 

## Running the benchmarks

From the root styled-components directory run this command to run all the benchmarks and see the result in the console:

```sh
yarn run benchmarks
```
